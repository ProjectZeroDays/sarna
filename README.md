<h2 align="center"> Security Assessment Report geNerated Automatically </h2>

## What is SARNA?

Well, the name is clear, SARNA is a tool to generate security assessment reports automatically in DOCX format.
It aims to solve a problem I have been having. As a pentester everybody knows that writing reports sucks, and
at the end you spend a lot of time copy pasting things from other reports (like definitions or other things),
and if, for some reason, you have to do your reports in DOCX, there is no easy way to automatize that.

SARNA is a **collaborative platform** that let a group of pentesters to work together to make a great report.
You have to concentrate in hacking and breaking things, and hopefully, **SARNA will do de boring part of the report**.

### Why the name

Sarna is the Spanish name for Scabies. In Spain we have a saying "sarna con gusto no pica" in english is something 
like "Scabies with pleasure does not itch". It is a little bit disgusting, but at the end, it means that if you have
something bad (like having to make a report), but you get something good with it in exchange (like doing it 
fast with this tool), it is not that bad at the end.
